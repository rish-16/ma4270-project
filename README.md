In this project, we show connections between the **Transformer** and the **Kernel Regression**. We show how the dot product between queries and keys can be swapped out with miscellaneous kernel operations, chief among them being the _Nadaraya-Watson kernel_. We also empirically show how Self-attention variants can successfully learn on sequential data like periodic and aperiodic functions.
